# HiraBots Test

Sample project for [this](https://github.com/herohiralal/HiraBots).

This is an abandoned project, because I realised that games (and MORE SPECIFICALLY AI) are a lot more about gameplay, design and feel, than they are about emergent AI behaviours.

If I were to ever make AI for any of my games, I'd rather just write the enemy behaviour script directly, composing it with functions instead of trying to model it around a visual tool or something. Behaviour trees would be the next preference. GOAP/LGOAP wouldn't even be close.
